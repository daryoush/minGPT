# (Since Julia's garbage collector is written in C, such events can be detected using the C=true
# output mode described below, or by using ProfileView.jl.)
#https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/profile/#Memory-allocation-analysis-1

# format – Introduced above, determines whether backtraces are printed with (default, :tree) or without (:flat) indentation indicating tree structure.
# C – If true, backtraces from C and Fortran code are shown (normally they are excluded). Try running the introductory example with Profile.print(C = true). This can be extremely helpful in deciding whether it's Julia code or C code that is causing a bottleneck; setting C = true also improves the interpretability of the nesting, at the cost of longer profile dumps.
# combine – Some lines of code contain multiple operations; for example, s += A[i] contains both an array reference (A[i]) and a sum operation. These correspond to different lines in the generated machine code, and hence there may be two or more different addresses captured during backtraces on this line. combine = true lumps them together, and is probably what you typically want, but you can generate an output separately for each unique instruction pointer with combine = false.
# maxdepth – Limits frames at a depth higher than maxdepth in the :tree format.
# sortedby – Controls the order in :flat format. :filefuncline (default) sorts by the source line, whereas :count sorts in order of number of collected samples.
# noisefloor – Limits frames that are below the heuristic noise floor of the sample (only applies to format :tree). A suggested value to try for this is 2.0 (the default is 0). This parameter hides samples for which n <= noisefloor * √N, where n is the number of samples on this line, and N is the number of samples for the callee.
# mincount – Limits frames with less than mincount occurrences.
#
